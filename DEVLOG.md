8:45 AM back at it

I've got my gears figured out. I need to finish designing the pan/tilt assembly, make it, fix some measurement issues then fully assemble the body.

Then add the basic electronics to the buggy that it will drive.

10:21 AM

Man this is slow. I did some cleaning earlier but that was only like 20 mins

Damn I'm losing steam, realizing how much time it will take to print stuff

11:05 AM

I need the power of the poompa (my playlist and headphones)

Drown myself in music to get through it

# YEAAAH YEAAAH YEAHHHH AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

11:29 AM

bearing press fit print test, too loose

9:39 AM

I just modeled the Pi Zero 2 W, I have more parts to do.

I'm concerned about driving the servos from the Pi, but maybe it will be okay.

Last time I used an Arduino board that talked to the Pi. I think I just need to put some pull up resistors on the servos to keep them calm on boot.

11:30 AM

The left/right sensors are 0.9" away from the camera lens midpoint

*Gloria... you're always on the run now...*

11:59 AM

Still don't have a pan-tilt design yet.

I modeled the servo arms because I'm going to end up cutting them, putting them as a slot in whatever gear set I design.

Because making 3D printed servo horn splines is not a great idea in my experience/level of accuracy.

I'm glad to be working in Python, it's easier than C++

2:06 PM

Damn... slow going, test printing gears to make sure they work well

2:13 PM

Losing steam... but will keep going.

3:53 PM

I'm kind of flailing right now.

I'm printing gears... realizing having one side it attaches to makes it tip that way hmm...

I'm going to mess around with the Pi Zero/test the servo motion.

4:29 PM

Not sure why I didn't decide to use the two-servo arm with two screws.

Using just one makes the gear dip one way/not be level. Also the screw heads are too close to the body sadly. So they have to come in from the other side, not much contact will use glue.

6:44 PM

Still stuck on the chaise longue (not showing up on wifi)

7:26 PM ahh man...

So I had to connect to an external monitor... I did some updates

I confirmed that the ip address was the one I thought it would be, it doesn't identify itself as a pi

Now I have SSH'd into it by my ASUS C100P Chromebook

Where I will write some servo test code.

8:04 PM

ran servo with Python using ASUS

problem with git though, concerned about degrees not going that far
