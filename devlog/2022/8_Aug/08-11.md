Carry over tasks
- imu setup
- web interface
- pi socket server
- servo interface (functions to use dynamic PWM setting)
- basic IMU sampling with left/right panning
  - known externally validated angles with the PWM commands
  - vs. gyro sampling see error

A little distracted today, first time I came across this Win 10 bitlocker deal while resetting a device

Also feel pretty spent... but I'll get something done

I topped up the battery supposedly it has 3400mAh not sure of total current draw

I'll keep an eye on htop

nah this ain't happening I'm spent, maybe later after I eat

I'll keep it on and log the time

7:48 PM

Yeah it's odd... when I first run `sudo i2cdetect -y 1` the 68 address isn't there the first time.

Second time it's there.

Also the `python3 mpu9250.py` command fails first few times... so do the above call again to scan bus.... few times you do that, then the imu call starts to work...

I'm not sure what that means but that's what I'm going to write a try-catch-promise wrapper around, till the imu starts

9:16 PM

time checkin, up time is 3 hrs 21 mins so far, just sitting idle though

I have an external power supply where I can watch the current draw, could do that but would have to pull the battery out

11:40 PM

I just happened to check it and it's dead so seems like a safe assumption is 4 hrs
