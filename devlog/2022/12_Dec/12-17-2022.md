Alright... slept in a bit much, chilling a bit

Before I enter a food coma from binging let me try and achieve something.

Last time I was able to use OpenCV 2's panorama stitching module/thing to make a panorma so now I have to integrate that into this robot's navigation system.

- [ ] take 6 photos, scale em down
- [ ] perform panorama with all 6 (easiest)
  - alternative is top 3, bottom 3, then top + bottom
- [ ] perform blob finding
- [ ] do pointing math with offsets in mind
- [ ] start doing depth scanning and measurements

I'm also curious on the stitching speed on the Pi Zero 2

distracted, cat wants to play ha

got a tape measure down to see what's visible

Damn, stitcher can fail too, maybe too complex of an image to line up

Okay looks like I may have turned too far in either direction

Let me check the field of view

Lowest it sees is 4" away from itself

Let me see if I can just join these two panoramas with each other

Nope... probably need to crop it

Hmm the top and bottom sets don't really line up with each other interesting

Maybe I could try vertical slices... idk

It's odd for the top set most of the right image is not used

I could try taking more images... I think ultimately the issue is how my camera moves around

Hmm... still not working, wondering what if I use the robot's wheels, that introduces new problems though

Will confirm left and right angles

Left side is 40, right side is 42 it's close

Alright... (sigh) let me try more images

holy crap that worked... hmm

amazing... let me see how big it can see

well you'd say 80 degrees FOV at least plus the 40 on either side...

so like 120 deg? ha need to prove that, point it at a wall
