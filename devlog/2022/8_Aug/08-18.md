Just planning right now, the next work is hard.

- [ ] IMU horizon leveling using NED
  - have to port C++ code I put together to Python
- [ ] centering panning
  - use the red stiff wire as a reference
  - find it as a mask with OpenCV
- [ ] estimating motion
  - keep a loop going/store IMU data as the robot moves
  - average it
- [ ] OpenCV image segmentation
  - do it (basic)
  - aim the beams at it
- [ ] basic navigation
