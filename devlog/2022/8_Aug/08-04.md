Half ass sucks

Printed the entire thing, was hard to get the supports out, broke stuff.

Had to update design and reprint in parts, up the infil too.

Doing IMU first

This looks good

Hmm gravity is not accurate it's below 9.8

It should be enough to do NED though

tof

using smbus2

modifying VL53L0X file

nvm same issue module not found ugh

Got this working but there's an issue with the whole library imports... can only get my code to run in the folder of the library...

Not a huge deal I can probably just start that file as a thread/looping function and call into it as needed but yeah

ehh

Oh damn I got lucky, looks like Pi only has one uart port, or at least immediately available

also the concern mixing python2 and 3

I'll get this all sorted after I make all the methods callable

I still have to wire everything up

So far it seems things prefer to work with python3

lol no there's more than one serial `dtoverlay -a`

7:51 PM
having troubles interfacing with Lidar... script I usually use doesn't work

Holy crap this [tfmini-s library](https://github.com/budryerson/TFMini-Plus_python) is good

It makes the TFmini-s accurate as hell, like below 30cm

Wow

Oh crap this thing is for tfmini plus but somehow it works on the s

Well it does say in the readme it's compatible, that's great

11:54 PM
wow this thing is awesome... it's a unit... stands on its own

I can just program it wireless by SSH ha (not great, would actually git clone down)

So tomorrow I'll build the tail dragger robot which is pretty straight forward.

Then I'll program the first navigation attempts... I still have an issue to deal with the MPU6050 i2c not being reliable... I tried another new MPU6050 and same issue... think it's related to the library or how I have two i2c devices... the tof one is rock solid though... that's interesting. Lidar is using serial so not affected.
