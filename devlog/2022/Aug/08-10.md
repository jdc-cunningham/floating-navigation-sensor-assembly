So... what I want to work on is the startup procedure.

Since everytime it turns on, the LED is usually leaking some power and needs to be turned off (have an "led off" function).

The next thing is to level the bed... using the IMU. However the IMU has startup problems too... so I'll have to make a try catch promise deal that waits for the IMU to be ready.

I'll also go ahead and start a web interface so I can have the Pi have a websocket to realy telemetry/commands other than SSH.

Generally development will occur outside of the Pi and then the Pi you just pull it down by git.

Oh yeah I'd also like to make interfaces for the servos so they work/can be ran

It's so cool being able to remotely program something.

Ha that's funny when I scroll in SSH I can hear the Pi processing

Man... no structure to my code right now good link here
