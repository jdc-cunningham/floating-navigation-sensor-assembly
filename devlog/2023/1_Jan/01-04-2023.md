damn... 2023 baby it's here

I've been spending my free time working on a friend's project for his business so I haven't worked on this in a bit

I'm feeling spent/burnt now but want to do something

recently I had to drop mega money on health related matters, even more broke...

means I gotta wrap up my personal projects and start trying to hustle

I still have some other new topics I wanted to get into eg. FPGA and Oscilloscope/Toshiba 50 CT modernizing (not even sure if I can do this)

Oh and I have a indoor garden related robot project in mind

Anyway let me see if I can get into this

My friend bought me a giant F16 lol 80mm EDF... gotta fly that at some point

Vision Nav process goes like this

- generate panorama
- find blobs by color
- use depth probes to determine locations
- use IMU and motion to keep track of those items afer deciding which way to go

That's the high-level... but each step gets broken down further

- pull the HSV values automatically
- factor in size of beams
- get pixel pointing geometry right

Eventually I need to put time into my legged robot too, I forget it exists since I hide it in a drawer from my cat

Yeah... I'm not feeling it, feel tired damn it

6:32 PM

I'll try one thing... write the code to find the center convergence of the red lines

6:39 PM

I have enough test material to work with without using the actual robot for a bit till I work out some stuff

Also thankfully it looks like I won't need surgery so won't be bankrupt from the bills heh
