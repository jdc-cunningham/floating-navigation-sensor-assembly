I have an idea for the red-x center finding... it's crappy and not the best approach.

I would pretty much take random slices to find the perfectly red pixel (hopefully the panorama has not shifted the red values somehow)

Anyway once I get at least two intersections (easy) and start working inwards... to find the converging slopes

I'll crowd source to see what people think

But that's an approach I can imagine doing
