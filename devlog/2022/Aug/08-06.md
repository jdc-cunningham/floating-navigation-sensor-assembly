Ahh fresh day although it's already 5 PM now been working on it since 8 the wifi buggy

I forgot how this process works that I came up with for blob finding based on HSV

Referring to my [notes/old code](https://github.com/jdc-cunningham/slam-crappy/tree/master/vision)

- unable to localte libjasper-dev, libpng12-dev

Will proceed without

I think this is the sequence of steps:

- 1D
- 2D
- apply mask
- find contours

python3-opencv install seems to work... I forgot for SSH the matploglib gui won't show up so I was developing this on a Ubuntu VM back then.

10:23 PM

I'm just poking around... idk what happened to this IMU

It worked fine on its own, after it's in parallel with the ToF ranging it's not working anymore or very rarely.

I've seen some mentions it should use 3.3V...

So both the MPU6050 and VL53L0X can operate at 3.3V so I'll power it with that.

It's a little better but still broken

Yeah this is a problem, I have to figure out why it keeps doing this IO error
