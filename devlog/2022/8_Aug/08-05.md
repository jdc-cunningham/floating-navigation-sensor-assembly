7:36 PM

Well I rewired it, took me a bit

What I'm having a problem with now is the MPU6050 code is not working.

I see the IMU on the address bus but it keeps saying can't find it.

Everything else checks, still have to run the camera.

I also designed and printed out the bottom stand.

I'm reprinting the cross with some mods (bigger and stronger)

Ohh... a wire broke off interesting.

lol both wires were broken off when I bent it into place, nice

It might be interference, my wire is very long, it's 

8:40 PM

Well... for some reason that i2c port does not want to work

SDA to GND is at 0.9V or so not sure why

I retouched the GPIO pins no change

I'll touch it up one more time, but if nothing else I'll use the parallel wire method and use the same bus.

Yeah I'm gonna have to try and paralell bus wire hmm
