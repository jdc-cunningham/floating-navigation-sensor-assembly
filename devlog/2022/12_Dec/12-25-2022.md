Ayeeeee Christmas

This 5-days off in a row has been great

12:40 PM

taking notes, a little distracted

I will start doing measurements today, I want to have accurate distance finding by my test NOS color box

12:49 PM

still not focused, let me use my trusted playlist

these are not absolute values, parallax issues

7.38" camera from the ground
7.00" tfmini-s from the ground
7.88" tof from the ground

0.79" tof left to middle (camera)
0.96" tfmini-s right to middle (camera)

The sensors are centered with rotation, the camera is not...

but camera output (pan) should be centered

Oh yeah I can add vertical lines on the middle scenes to hopefully help with the panorama gen process

0.42" camera is above tilt midpoint/sensor centers

actually the vertical lines on other photos would probably not help

I think I'll add x and +

1:10 PM

Crap I'm missing a line from the x

These x's will also cause problems in the contour finding since they are applied on the final crop, I need to have copies without them

1:20 PM

wtf my tof model is not right in sketchup, the sensor (black rectangle) is on the wrong side vertically hmm

1:24 PM
ugh... I'll do the crosshair replacement now

1:32 PM

oof nasty, even longer generation process

The crosshair is for figuring out what is the center of the panorama.

From there you would know which way to do pointing with the sensors relative to the image.

I still ahve to reason out the distances/what is visible.

I think it is a flaw about FOV/pointing since you can't tell if a tiny thing is tiny/close or far/small.

The sensors will determine which is which.

1:37 PM

I have to work out the pointing geometry

convert pixel coordinate on a photo to angles on servos

the pan/tilt angles are not mapped right now, have to do manual at first, then tie to IMU (this would be the intended feedback) vs. say a rotation encoder

I need to start doing some manual measurement testing to make sense of this pointing

1:49 PM

okay this test, the NOS box is

11" right, 44" - 9" away from camera

Eventually I do want an interface for this robot, with telemetry

Not hard to make just something on the list

2:05 PM

feeling distracted

ugh... gotta do it twice, the auto crop, even more delay

2:13 PM

getting a drink/snack, will measure the face of the NOS box

I'm using GIMP to get the expected pixel values from photos

oh damn forgot new episode of Witch Gundam hell yeah

2:53 PM

ooh that was a good one

got about 3 hours left before I have a big break, probably done today on this project

minor file name mistake
