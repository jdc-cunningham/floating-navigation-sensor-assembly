A little distracted today, first time I came across this Win 10 bitlocker deal while resetting a device

Also feel pretty spent... but I'll get something done

I topped up the battery supposedly it has 3400mAh not sure of total current draw

I'll keep an eye on htop

nah this ain't happening I'm spent, maybe later after I eat

I'll keep it on and log the time
