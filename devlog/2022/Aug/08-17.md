Didn't do anything yesterday

I'm going to fix the startup stuff, hopefully can interface with everything

Ahh man... got a headache

I'm starting to formulate next goals that'll get me pumped/motivated to make big strides with this project.

One is a test calibration of the image segmenting/depth mapping, to see how accurate the aiming is.
