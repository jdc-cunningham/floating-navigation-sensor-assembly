### Basic
- assembled
- bridge to basic 2D car platform
- basic blob finding/distance/navigation

### Corrective navigation
- shows a photo it took, direction it decided
- I say if it was correct or not, update future decisions

### Insane
- place the sensor assembly on a desk looking down at the floor
  sees the robot on the floor and some obstacles at this angle
  able to steer the robot based on known size/perceived distance away
