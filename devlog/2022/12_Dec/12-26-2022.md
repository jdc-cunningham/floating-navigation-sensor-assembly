Let me try and get some work done before food coma sets in

I just shopped/re-upped on food

2:14 PM

a little distracted, not sure how wide to pan

I'll visualize it

I'll go for 120 deg, 60 deg in either direction

center pan is 1460, increasing turns left, decreasing turns right

I'll have to setup a camera to be directly over the robot as I try out some values

To capture frames to use with SketchUp and dial in/write a formula function deg to ms
