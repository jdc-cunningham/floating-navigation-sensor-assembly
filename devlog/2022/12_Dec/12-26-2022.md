Let me try and get some work done before food coma sets in

I just shopped/re-upped on food

2:14 PM

a little distracted, not sure how wide to pan

I'll visualize it

I'll go for 120 deg, 60 deg in either direction

center pan is 1460, increasing turns left, decreasing turns right

I'll have to setup a camera to be directly over the robot as I try out some values

To capture frames to use with SketchUp and dial in/write a formula function deg to ms

2:29 PM

mad distracted, let's go

1.5 deg to the left, starting photo

38.9 turn left, 37.4 true

35.5 right, 34 true

not symmetrical

400ms turn either direction

2:47 PM

anyway... a first guess is

3:09 PM

alright let me check how accurate it is

next sample

2.6 deg left neutral (hopefully just from camera)

46.5 left, 43.9, so it's a deg off

46.8 right, 44.2 deg

see what I'm doing

I think this offset is acceptable since the FOV's are big/rough estimates as well

it's probably a rounding issue anyway that tiny deg off

3:19 PM

now I have to do a tilt setup (camera)

after this I think I will go for it, be able to produce a video of the whole flow including the HSV/mask application/find item coordinate, point beam at it, get distance, overlay

I'll be able to rest at peace with that... for my break

feel like I achieved something

3:27 PM

tilt servo increase to look down

the camera/sensors may not be vertical at rest hmm

3.2 tilted backwards, negative from vertical as neutral

17.6 look down at 220ms, 14.4 deg true -> 15.28 multiplier

3.9 neutral

23.6 up, 19.7 actual -> 11.17 multiplier

repeatability is an issue, go back to neutral and it's slightly offset
