Let's keep this going

Going to do some measurements/try to figure out aiming

I need to figure out how to get the offset from the red dot

<img src="../../images/top-view.png"/>

Here you can see an example scenario

The orange NOS box is 38" away roughly

I'll use sketchup to get an angle

36.9 degrees look to the right

Let me get a panorama

hmm have to start pigpiod manually again, will edit boot script

wtf it's already there hmm

ugh... gotta figure out why this isn't running on boot

I had a crontab but it wasn't working

maybe because I changed the repo name

let me search in devlog

6:26 PM

ugh... found it

`/usr/lib/systemd/system/bootFNSA.service`

doing quick test

need to write this down somewhere

6:37 PM

still not working hmm

6:45 PM

journal says it's running but having problems

python import fails from ToF sensor

pigpiod

`sudo journalctl -u bootFNSA.service`

hmm... thought the requirements would already be installed even if repo is fresh

at least I have the requirements.txt

good thing I have notes

I wonder if this is because of some compiled file being removed hmm

Ugh... man I have a lot of hardcoded paths, the home folder in particular that's the issue

dang easier to fix in editor than nano

7:19 PM

one quick restart test, then back to what I was trying to do before

going to disable the IMU websocket thread since it's not used right now
