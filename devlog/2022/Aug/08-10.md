So... what I want to work on is the startup procedure.

Since everytime it turns on, the LED is usually leaking some power and needs to be turned off (have an "led off" function).

The next thing is to level the bed... using the IMU. However the IMU has startup problems too... so I'll have to make a try catch promise deal that waits for the IMU to be ready.

I'll also go ahead and start a web interface so I can have the Pi have a websocket to realy telemetry/commands other than SSH.

Generally development will occur outside of the Pi and then the Pi you just pull it down by git.

Oh yeah I'd also like to make interfaces for the servos so they work/can be ran

It's so cool being able to remotely program something.

Ha that's funny when I scroll in SSH I can hear the Pi processing

Man... no structure to my code right now good link here

ahh man this thing is using PWM, I don't really understand PWM

Damn these servos are solid using hardware PWM, I can barely move the servos with my hands

Problem is they're too fast... trying to figure out how to slow it down.

What's crazy is the TFmini-s lidar puts out heat... I can feel it with my hand wow...

crap it died

anyway I'm currently struggling with getting the python scripts to actually run from rc.local

ahh... it's deprecated nice

so I'll fix that later today, the battery takes a bit to charge, I charge it at 1A

I do wish I had an ADC on this thing so I could sample the battery voltage, oh well.

After eating, going to see if I can get this start up script to work

need this `chmod +x`

10:22 PM

Dang guess it's not charged enough crazy

10:39 PM

nice rebooted it and the startup script ran
