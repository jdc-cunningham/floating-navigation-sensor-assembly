Late start, I slept in, been chilling

I want to work on the vision bit some more today.

Specifically I want to do a panorama with known physic FOV dimensions

Then try to find things, point and actually start to navigate.

I'll probably put some time into the bad websocket too where the wifi buggy will not stop moving.

Can is 10" away

Can is 10" tall

Photo is 3280x2464

Can is 2382 pixells tall when fully in view

FOV is 13" wide at 10" away

This is an 8MP Raspi Cam V2

People say 62.2x48.8 FOV

Others say 110deg for 1080p, 720p 70deg

I'm taking full resolution images though

Need to read on FOV

It's awesome having a full linux os though with apt package manger

I think I'm gonna make a basic interactive CLI controller for the servo since the websocket lag sucks

Oh okay...

Says

horizontal fov 62.2 deg

vertical fov 48.8 deg

Now if only I knew what that means lol

I can probably model it in sketchup

Confirm it with the dimensions
