1:34 PM

definitely late start today, got some meeting later on so only have like 4 hours

pretty fresh mentally though so let's go

the center finding doesn't work all the way yet, it doesn't self iterate

I have a day off tomorrow but I'll use that for personal software stuff

self reflection (am I f'd that kind of thing, is my life my own to live, of course it is if I can be an ahole or choose to exercise freewill/nihilism)

I think green is more rare than red actually

1:42 PM

I'll have to generate a new panorama set with the green

ehh... I could try what I have now, I don't want to go backwards

Ideally you'd have all three crosshairs in case there's a problem with any

1:53 PM

ehh I kind of wrote some of this code already in compare

2:04 PM

I need an avg and min-max
