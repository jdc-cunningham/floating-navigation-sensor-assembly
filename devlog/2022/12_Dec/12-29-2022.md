damn I'm losing track of the days, thought today was 28 still

I want to experiment with draw io... think things through

in VS code pretty cool

whoa... this is cool (drawio interface in VS Code)

some things I've been thinking about

- shoud know from math if the FOV is hitting the ground at some distance
  - level vs. down some degree, etc...

I'm pretty beat so not really going to get  far
