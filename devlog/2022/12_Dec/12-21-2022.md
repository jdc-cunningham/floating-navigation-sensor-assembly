I do have a headache right now/feel mentally spent, cat's also distracting me, wants to play

ooh freeze warning down to single temps dang, like that scene in Day After Tomorrow helicopters fall out of the sky

what I'm trying to add is a "cross-sight" in red on the center image, so it is more resiliant than the single red dot

I'll have to add an alignment thing though later

6:48 PM

keep getting distracted, I have a video in mind/vision of all the parts working so I'm working towards that goal

I have some holiday time off hell yeah
