definitely late start today, got some meeting later on so only have like 4 hours

pretty fresh mentally though so let's go

the center finding doesn't work all the way yet, it doesn't self iterate

I have a day off tomorrow but I'll use that for personal software stuff

self reflection (am I f'd that kind of thing, is my life my own to live, of course it is if I can be an ahole or choose to exercise freewill/nihilism)

I think green is more rare than red actually

1:42 PM

I'll have to generate a new panorama set with the green

ehh... I could try what I have now, I don't want to go backwards

Ideally you'd have all three crosshairs in case there's a problem with any

1:53 PM

ehh I kind of wrote some of this code already in compare

2:04 PM

I need an avg and min-max

2:09 PM

good news is this is really accurate

this color dump find so far

```
[[665, 480], [665, 481]]
[[715, 452], [715, 453]]
[[765, 423], [765, 424]]
[[815, 391], [815, 392], [815, 393]]
[[865, 359], [865, 360], [865, 361]]
[[965, 31], [965, 32], [965, 33], [965, 291], [965, 292], [965, 293]]
[[1015, 71], [1015, 72], [1015, 172], [1015, 173], [1015, 174], [1015, 175], [1015, 256], [1015, 257]]
[[1065, 110], [1065, 111], [1065, 112], [1065, 164], [1065, 165], [1065, 166], [1065, 168], [1065, 169], [1065, 170], [1065, 171], [1065, 172], [1065, 220], [1065, 221]]
[[1115, 149], [1115, 150], [1115, 151], [1115, 164], [1115, 165], [1115, 166], [1115, 169], [1115, 170], [1115, 171], [1115, 172], [1115, 183], [1115, 184], [1115, 185]]
[[1165, 146], [1165, 147], [1165, 148], [1165, 167], [1165, 168], [1165, 188], [1165, 189], [1165, 190]]
[[1215, 168], [1215, 169], [1215, 226], [1215, 227], [1215, 228], [1215, 229]]
[[1265, 263], [1265, 264], [1265, 265], [1265, 266], [1265, 267]]
```

You can see for 965, that's the first set where you have a descending and ascending line found (two points)

So you do need an explicit break on the outer edges so you're not counting a solid red section for example

the other thing I'm counting on is the specific range of colors

oh yeah one othe thing I can do to prove that it's right is the angle between the two lines

74.3 degrees (SketchUp check)

2:38 PM

working on a Medium story, another ego grab

I ran out of rubbing alcohol so I'm not using my main keyboard right now, sucks

I'll get some more tomorrow

2:55 PM

alright "achievment" by blog post

I need to take a brief break, I'll be back

3:17 PM

okay back on, I'll brave my uncleaned keyboard, just because using others slows me down

3:20 PM

this is where the Leetcode stuff comes in, what is the least piece of crap way to do this

I can set rules like maximum cluster of red pixels should be 5 or less

it's a 2-3 pixel wide line but the stagger increases it

ha yeah exactly:

```
The line thickness depends heavily on the angle; diagonal lines are much thicker than horizontal or vertical lines. Also, the thickness of the lines is anyway wrong (3 at thinnest) as you noticed. Using anti-alias does not make a significant change.
```

https://stackoverflow.com/a/24687564/2710227

Yeah so I put 2, and it's about 3, maybe I should cap it at 3 so it's super strict


`[[965, 31], [965, 32], [965, 33], [965, 291], [965, 292], [965, 293]]`

This one is pretty perfect, 2 sets of 3

I need to write a function to process this, find two sets of lines, nothing more/less

Random thought, with AI generated art becoming more mainstream, a text to movie would be interesting

Seed it with images (if you have em) and rebuild your memories as a video to be watched ha

Authenticity is something else but yeah

If you merged it with other people's videos/recollections, verify truthiness

Okay I'm just going to write this crudely (counting upwards/grouping)

3:44 PM

damn I wrote this wrong

AIN'T GOT NO VISA... damn Timbaland hitting hard

4:01 PM

Alright got a function that finds the y-intercepts of two red lines if present

4:12 PM

lol when you loop a song over and over to focus

it's like "it gets the algo right or it hears the music again"

AIN'T GOT NO MONEY...

I'm getting confused by the sets of x,y pairs from y intercepts since I have to separate/join them by same line/slope

I am concerned this is a the happy path/convenient, other panos it won't work...

4:20 PM

amazing... you write a bunch of crap, hit enter and you get the basic array of 2 points (center of camera FOV)

but is it correct...

sadly it is not

I'll have to check if it's because the points are bad, it's close but the deviation is too high

we want 1138, 168

but I got 1201, 162 instead

6% overshoot in x axis, about 4% under for y axis

4:29 PM

quick snack

I mentioned before how the lines can be curved... lol

but it's not major

I gotta step through this

I can be lazy and just plot the points on a graph and see them intercept

yeah it's correct, 1201 by 163 using this

4:34 PM

I see, so the 965, 292 point is at the very top of the diagonal line... it's not in the middle

damn the second points went really far too...

it's 1165 which is beyond the crosshair around 1137

50 is such a small nubmer too, crazy the giant gap

I see, a set at 1065, has 8 points for the same coordinate

Oh that's the orange box yeah...

I think I shouldn't throw it out entirely just because there was a patch found

you want that crisp, 3 point cluster

I will try green

4:55 PM

oh damn I'll have to update the red pixel range with green ones

5:01 PM

watching the space x falcon heavy launch, amazing

it's cool seeing the flow of the smoke/atmosphere next to each other, the two side boosters returning to Earth

be cool to see a simulation of that/planning the minimum distance apart

5:06 PM

let me do a quick update, add some green values

hmm I did a different panorama and the crop is really bad, lost most of the image, interesting

the pan output is good

5:09 PM

I'm going to have to retake the pano, not today

I'll also have to update those green ranges

investigate why the pano crop was so bad

5:12 PM

I'd take the pano now but my cat's in the way

29, 95, 22
86, 165, 81

4, 122, 0
66, 212, 53

4, 95, 0
66, 165, 53

5:15 PM

ehhh let me try it

the pano failing is probably the min non-black pixel setting

it was not satisfied till only looking at the carpet (pano crop output was just a rectangle of the black carpet)

which... doesn't make sense, that means it's not truly black
