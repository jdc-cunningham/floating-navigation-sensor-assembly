Alright going to try the SPI example as is and see if I can get raspberry pi to talk to it.

Seems like ground has to be shared between the two devices okay (Alpacino) you wanna share ground? okay

7:54 PM
I had a desperate thought, let me try an MPU9250

It would suck to have to fit that inside somehow but if it works...

I am still having problems with I2C 0 (all addresses show up)

I ran pigpio test and none of the GPIOs are failing

So I'm not sure what's up with that

8:16 PM

Ugh... so I am trying the MPU9250 despite its larger size

its operation is problematic as well

I had it work once, looped for as long as I wanted, stoppped

8:25 PM

Well I'm a quitter, I'm swapping the electronics out with MPU9250

9:28 PM
MPU9250 is in and working (it fails to work at first)
