well... had to sell most of my expensive camera gear so I can have some extra buffer cash

Sad times

Anyway I submitted this project for a talk although I doubt it would be even considered since it's laughable/junk.

Still gives me motivation to reach the goal of it completely working

I also need to "finish" this project so I can do other things

5:53 PM

back on did some exercises for my knee, went to PT, got some home exercises

I still feel spent around this time... idk

gotta power through it though, free myself

Anyway looks like my green range was not good

6:03 PM

will take a brief break

6:24 PM

back on, eating granola bar maybe it helps

1163 is almost the middle/vetical line so that's not good

running iterate_samples() method

it's better but still picking up the edges of the green lines

still bad, expanding range

this is not going well...

I can do white

the problem is I can't seem to get a perfect color, there's always a range... since the rgb value is slapped ontop of an existing color (camera footage)

white is probably a bad idea, too many light-colored things in frame

but the monkey will try

another idea is to make a multi-colored crosshair, where it's sandwiched... definite pattern to find

7:06 PM

tf I'm getting a random "invalid syntax" on the os.system take photo call

.dtbo what is that

doing an update/upgrade

oh I'm dumb it's python3

7:14 PM

cat just ruined the pano

that would be interesting detect blurring


7:26 PM

idk... white could be good for contrast

this crop is pretty bad

center is 1146, 490

173, 174, 174
214, 217, 220

196, 196, 196
208, 209, 208

ehh... this is also not that great

oh we got it... intersection at 1145, 489 that's pretty spot on

using this min/max range set

min_white_range = [100, 100, 100]
max_white_range = [255, 255, 255]

I think I can move on with this... I have the FOV stuff to do still although before that I need to automate the masking/blob finding from contours

I do have to check clearance of the camera one day

I've assumed looking forward is good enough, not sure if I need to look up some as well to avoid overhangs
