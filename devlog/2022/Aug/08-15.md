Distracted today, late start but I ate fast food so I have energy from my usual dieting self

I did do a time check and the system lasts just over 6 hrs like near 6 hrs exactly.

Does this help me? Not really since there's no way to reset a timer after being charged... but good to know I guess.

Today I'll finish interfacing with stuff, with regard to the classes

I'm going to develop the first navigation version and then I have to take a break to learn some Swift boy... I'm also learning Haskell lol or was... so yeah...

I'm super distracted... not making much progress

7:55 PM

damn it Jacob get to work focus

I'm pretty much moving the prototype sample code for each thing (servo, sensor, etc...) to the actual class

8:25 PM

hmm... definitely squeezing crap in there

I'll be good and add a pip requirements file

ooh... https://stackoverflow.com/a/48941162/2710227

looks easy enough

8:43 PM

Hmm... weird import/path issue for VL53L0X, taking a break

FEEEEDING TIME! WEEEEEEEEEE (pig sound)

10:41 PM

ugh... okay let's go, my hands are super dried out

11:00 PM

Ugh I'm stuck on import problems, I fix one thing it breaks others

hmm

I know i should mock the sensor endpoints/not code against the Pi the SSH adds lag

The VL53L0X has a relative import eg. `../bin...` which was fine for its purpose, I had to modify it

I don't really know what the hell I'm doing with all these imports so
