Let's gooooo, got some sleep, day off

Will work on finding the center of the red + parts

Then I'll calibrate it for measurement... it's possible there is a fundamental approach with what I'm doing where you can't really gauge where something is with just one camera.

"motion parallax" interesting

How do I get anything done like this

<img src="../../images/apollo-in-the-way.JPG"/>

There is something else I have to do, I have to find the optimal crop

It's -5F right now and it is cold haha, window behind my monitor, I feel a breeze, got the fold at home running on low to generate some heat

I have to come from the top and find the lowest non-black pixel and then from the sides, lowest meaning towards the middle.

My approach would have been to use 4 loops which you could use just one

ha written in c++

anyway I think I can do this, I just remember iterating through pixels was slow as hell

This photo is 2535x1309 as in roughly 3.32 million pixels

That can take some time

Wow yeah... this is super slow

will take a few minutes to iterate over all the pixels

hmm

think I could cheat and use imagemagick lol

this one looks good

I've used findContours before, it's the main thing I use to find blobs

hmm that approach is failing
