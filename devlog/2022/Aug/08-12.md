Carry over tasks
- imu setup
- web interface
- pi socket server
- servo interface (functions to use dynamic PWM setting)
- basic IMU sampling with left/right panning
  - known externally validated angles with the PWM commands
  - vs. gyro sampling see error

I have some energy left today

I want to write that "promisified IMU startup" thing and then add a basic web socket server on the pi side for a web interface to connect to, I just want to see statuses outside of the SSH session

6:52 PM

I'm sidetracked at the moment

I'm going to look at old websocket code I wrote for another project this websockets library is not working for me right now, supposed to be trivial, not gonna get into it

8:30 PM

feeding time (pig sound weeeeee)

I got distracted... I'm still looking for a simple websocket implementation in python... one that works

I tried the websockets one and my web interface won't connect to it for some reason

Post meal, been charging it, let me see if I can knock this out, my hands are drying out at this point, it's nasty

Tomorrow I'll figure out the PWM stuff, how to make it slow

I think overall as a weekend goal I'll do the first crude navigation/full "integration" with the wifi buggy

Oh yeah I forgot the term is image segmentation regarding the OpenCV stuff

Nice I already wrote one in the past

...and it's the websockets I tried to use lol

I do notice the response is kind of lagged... I'm pinging it, pinging t, pinging it then it responds like alright cool

11:44 PM

damn I just got into a non-ending loop lol

the Popen communicate won't stop

There's something funky with the BMS, like it will not want to start up until I charge the battery a little

I'm gonna have to figure out how to address this tomorrow.

How to stop the inner loop, need to send a command in to kill the subprocess
