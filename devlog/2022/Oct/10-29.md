Not a good start, boot script not running, can't find Pi on WiFi network with arp scan

192.168.1.156... doesn't show up as an RPi interesting

Oh yeah... I remember this, the rc.local stuff I was doing before doesn't run on fresh start, only on reboot (CLI call)

looking into adding a systemd entry

oh lol I also turned it off in `/etc/rc.local`

calling it `bootFNSA.service`

getting sucked into crap back to producing things

losing track of what I'm trying to do... the IMU data to threejs plot real time yeah

at the end of the day it would be a basic thread you start like "stream telemetry" or something and that would get displayed on ThreeJS to track the robot head's orientation and trajectory over time.
