### About

This project is not really meant to be reproduced it's a learning platform for me.

Still all of the code is available and should be reproducible.

### Installation

You should see a `requirements.txt` file you can use that to get all the necessary libraries installed using:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Misc setup

The VL53L0X library has to be built using the `make` command.

Note that the folder within `.../sensors` is a direct clone, unmodified. Anyway you `cd` into the `VL53L0X_rasp_python` folder and run `make`.
