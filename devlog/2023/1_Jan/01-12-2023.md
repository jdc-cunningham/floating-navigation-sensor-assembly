I'm feeling positive right now regarding energy

This seems to work well for me right now:

- cup of coffee (spoonful medium ground, per cup), pb&j
- cup of coffee, pb&j
- can of NOS (normal sized can)
- Tuna and Mayo around 4 PM

here I am now... don't feel like having a miserable headache

I had the order switched before eg. sandwich, tuna, sandwich

I'm also still not working out but looks like I'll do some physical therapy to fix my knee

back to this...

I'm going to figure out the min/max red color range

then hopefully that's not like a O^2 type algo with regard to two loops

5:50 PM

for center_sample (brightest red) it's

120, 8, 8 smallest
197, 48, 49

oh damn... just had a thought, depending on what the red crosshair is over, the value will change, if it's on a white background vs. darker
