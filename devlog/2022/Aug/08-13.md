Carry over tasks
- [x] imu setup
- [ ] web interface
  - bridged but not displayed yet
- [ ] pi socket server
  - prototyped need to tie into system/threads so can be used
- [ ] servo interface (functions to use dynamic PWM setting)
- [ ] basic IMU sampling with left/right panning
  - known externally validated angles with the PWM commands
  - vs. gyro sampling see error

Man's got a fresh brain here we go

I had a thought about that non-ending loop deal, it would be good to send commands into the sub process but also might just collect the terminal output and then do math on it.

The main thing I gotta do today is the PWM so I can set the rate of the servos, they're too fast right now.

Let me finish what I was doing yesterday the imu wake

9:30 AM

Alright I have the basic IMU wake process down, still need to tie it into the system

"the system"

9:52 AM

ugh... keep going
