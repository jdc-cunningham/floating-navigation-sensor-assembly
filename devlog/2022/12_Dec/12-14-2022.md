let me try and stitch these pics together real quick

7:17 PM

This is not working... will try something off the shelf just to see if my photos are salvageable

I don't want to be tinfoil hat but this thing will be navigating my apartment, don't want to send photos of that to remote places.

Would like to do it myself too but might be one of those things need to sink months of time into/have expertise.

Crap... my SD card might have died, can't transfer a file out

Oh wait... maybe it's a string length issue hmm

7:37 PM

oh damn cv2 has a stitching thing cool

7:43 PM

damn.... damn.... bow to the superior code, prostrate

It just works... this CV2 stitchy... beautiful

Okay... I'll see if i can use this for the others

I'll need to experiment and see if this is enough to see, just one level, I believe I need to look down too

7:53 PM

cool the project can move forward
