Ahh yeah... I did have a thought about the motion/imu stuff.

Whenever the robot moves I can have a check against the IMU, if I command it to move 10" the IMU should confirm that it moved roughly that amount otherwise it is stuck.

9:12 AM

slow start today, kind of just wondering...

9:33 AM

yeah still screwing around...

9:42 AM

yeah I'm struggling to get going

10:01 AM

omg... please Jacob, let's go come on

10:16 AM

I think after my snack at 11:00 AM

I'll do some class-based python programming to warm up

12:54 PM

Been distracted but starting to make progress again

1:54 PM

damn it died... part of the issue is I don't want to store it at full charge so I let it sit at idle for a couple hours while I chilled

What's nice is I'm starting to see how the code will come together.

I could actually write a CRON script on next charge, keep writing into a file every minute it's on

10:44 PM

I'm going to trust this BMS so far it has logged 57, 5 min intervals

I'll let it die overnight and see how long battery life it gets
