late start today but feeling the drive

I'm going to build the start of the web interface, the robot in the end will not use real time video streaming

but I want that ability as a manual override/initial control.

I want to remotely drive the thing around my apartment briefly, I'm concerned the onboard LED is not bright enough.

Oh damn... first problem, picamera not supported for Raspbian 64 bit

looks like there is something new for picamera2

https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2/blob/main/README.md#installation

I'm not sure if I'll get this to work... will see they have different examples

I'm looking at this one

hell yeah... found an example that works

https://github.com/raspberrypi/picamera2/blob/main/examples/mjpeg_server.py

this camera angle is narrow

camera is upside down but css rotate works on web side

have to point the camera down

12:22 PM

going to design/3D print these snap things to mount the camera head to the robot base

1:15 PM

I'm distracted designing and printing these parts to removably mount the head to the body

I need to design the web interface for manual control

It'll be similar to the actual autonomous view where I want to see the images it took, blobs found, decision it made

Seeing the narrow FOV the robot will probably have to pan/take 3 shots (panorama-ish) to evaluate it's surroundings to safely decide if it can go or not

Might have to do some kind of pixel matching to stitch images together damn that'll be hard

Ahh damn getting distracted

1:27 PM

This is easy stuff to build so I will just bang it out

Will have to do some mods on the RPi side too for starting the video stream, it shouldn't always run is the thing so I'll need a central web interface for the pi where I can toggle the manual command view on

Will wait till I'm done with the 3D printing stuff so I'm not distracted by that, can just bang out the code, gotta wash my hands again/clean the keyboard (dead skin build up can you believe that)

I also like a grippy keyboard

1:41 PM

print was bad again, broke it while trying to remove the supports, I rotated the design so the shear plane is othogonal (ooh big word) to the ground

it's distracting waiting to print/checking print, updating design, printing again so waiting for it while doing other personal stuff... I'll get this remote control prototyped/done today though

It will be kinda neat to steer it around at ground level

2:23 PM

satisfied with back stop mount, printing front clip

I want to show a side view of the thing mounted/looking at something and then checking the depth probe (if what you see in FOV can be fully scanned)

should be with 25FOV

the remote control with basic 45 deg turn/10 in forward still works that's cool

as I do these projects I wonder what's the point... I don't know, in the moment elation I guess when you make something

2:39 PM

I'm done, it's not great but I gotta move on
