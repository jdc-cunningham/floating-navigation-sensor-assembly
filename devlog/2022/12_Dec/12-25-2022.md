Ayeeeee Christmas

This 5-days off in a row has been great

12:40 PM

taking notes, a little distracted

I will start doing measurements today, I want to have accurate distance finding by my test NOS color box

12:49 PM

still not focused, let me use my trusted playlist

these are not absolute values, parallax issues

7.38" camera from the ground
7.00" tfmini-s from the ground
7.88" tof from the ground

0.79" tof left to middle (camera)
0.96" tfmini-s right to middle (camera)

The sensors are centered with rotation, the camera is not...

but camera output (pan) should be centered

Oh yeah I can add vertical lines on the middle scenes to hopefully help with the panorama gen process

0.42" camera is above tilt midpoint/sensor centers

actually the vertical lines on other photos would probably not help

I think I'll add x and +
