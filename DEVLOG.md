I just modeled the Pi Zero 2 W, I have more parts to do.

I'm concerned about driving the servos from the Pi, but maybe it will be okay.

Last time I used an Arduino board that talked to the Pi. I think I just need to put some pull up resistors on the servos to keep them calm on boot.

The left/right sensors are 0.9" away from the camera lens midpoint

Still don't have a pan-tilt design yet.

I modeled the servo arms because I'm going to end up cutting them, putting them as a slot in whatever gear set I design.

Because making 3D printed servo horn splines is not a great idea in my experience/level of accuracy.

I'm glad to be working in Python, it's easier than C++
