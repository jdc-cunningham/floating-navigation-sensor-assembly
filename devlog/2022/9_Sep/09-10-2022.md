9:10 AM (hey look at that)

So I'm back to my regular scheduled programming... our Hackathon won 1st place yeah boiiiiiiii

I'm still in disbelief ha

Anyway I'm trying to get motivation on this, I have another project in mind too (web/finance related)

I figured I'd do this one on a Saturday since I have more time

What I'd like to make today is a web interface that can receive the photo taken by the Pi (actually get it from self-hosted pi)

Then display the processing done on it, possibly do the processing by sliders.

Then from the depth plots, make a 3D depth plot with ThreeJS to see the found items

This would take the dimensions determined from the distance/pixels and create cubes for rough object placement

I'm not feeling it right now though, not motivated

Well... I'm gonna take a break/do something else for a bit.

9:26 AM

I'm charging the device though in the mean time.
