I have a cool project in mind, also vision related

gives me something to look forward to in the spring/summer

so I want to speed up this project

5:52 PM

I still have a headache, but not as bad, I reduced my near EOD caffeine intake but I ran out of jelly today (what)

for PB&J

so we have the center point of the camera (level with horizon, center image -- looking straight ahead)

now we need the targets to aim the depth probes at

5:59 PM

distracted

process is

- 1D histogram (V)
- 2D histogram (H, S)
- apply mask
- find contours
- find centroids
- compare with ToF beam FOV overlap/use lidar to verify against

I have to find that better lidar code

this is the good one... hmm

info on histograms

ugh... I can't read right now

6:07 PM

yeah... I'm not getting anywhere
