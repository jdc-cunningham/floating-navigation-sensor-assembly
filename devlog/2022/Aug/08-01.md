Trying to do some work on this.

Printing the pan-tilt cross bracket thing

I'm trying to simplify the pan/tilt setup, and also print it in parts/assemble it

Should use less material/be faster to print and can be changed

6:42 PM

I feel so spent, trying to get motivated to do this

7:27 PM

I'm struggling... not really getting anywhere

9:12 PM

I'm concerned about the gear rotation not working, printed out a basic shaft to check

11:05 PM
Need to extend/add end caps just to make sure pegs stay in.

Needs inner bushings/stoppings as well

11:23 PM

The motion is not smooth with this servo driver, will have to look into others

Also the max range is capped to the 90 degrees but Arduino has it more than that eg. full 180 degrees
