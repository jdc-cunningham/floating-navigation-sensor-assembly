Didn't do anything yesterday

I'm going to fix the startup stuff, hopefully can interface with everything

Ahh man... got a headache

I'm starting to formulate next goals that'll get me pumped/motivated to make big strides with this project.

One is a test calibration of the image segmenting/depth mapping, to see how accurate the aiming is.

Everything's wired up now code-wise... the next big thing is actually doing some navigation/getting the IMU loop back check working

I'll make a video now since it's a bit of content even though not much progress

After eating (more energy) I'll start working on the IMU loop back stuff possibly image segmentation/aiming the sensors at blobs
