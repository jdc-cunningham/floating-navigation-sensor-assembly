Distracted today, late start but I ate fast food so I have energy from my usual dieting self

I did do a time check and the system lasts just over 6 hrs like near 6 hrs exactly.

Does this help me? Not really since there's no way to reset a timer after being charged... but good to know I guess.

Today I'll finish interfacing with stuff, with regard to the classes

I'm going to develop the first navigation version and then I have to take a break to learn some Swift boy... I'm also learning Haskell lol or was... so yeah...

damn it Jacob get to work focus

I'm pretty much moving the prototype sample code for each thing (servo, sensor, etc...) to the actual class
