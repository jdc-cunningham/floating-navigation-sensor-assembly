Alright... slept in a bit much, chilling a bit

Before I enter a food coma from binging let me try and achieve something.

Last time I was able to use OpenCV 2's panorama stitching module/thing to make a panorma so now I have to integrate that into this robot's navigation system.

- [ ] take 6 photos, scale em down
- [ ] perform panorama with all 6 (easiest)
  - alternative is top 3, bottom 3, then top + bottom
- [ ] perform blob finding
- [ ] do pointing math with offsets in mind
- [ ] start doing depth scanning and measurements

I'm also curious on the stitching speed on the Pi Zero 2

distracted, cat wants to play ha

got a tape measure down to see what's visible

Damn, stitcher can fail too, maybe too complex of an image to line up

Okay looks like I may have turned too far in either direction
