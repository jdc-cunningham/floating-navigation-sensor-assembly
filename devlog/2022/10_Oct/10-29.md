Not a good start, boot script not running, can't find Pi on WiFi network with arp scan

192.168.1.156... doesn't show up as an RPi interesting

12:04 PM

Oh yeah... I remember this, the rc.local stuff I was doing before doesn't run on fresh start, only on reboot (CLI call)

looking into adding a systemd entry

https://roboticsbackend.com/make-a-raspberry-pi-3-program-start-on-boot/

oh lol I also turned it off in `/etc/rc.local`

calling it `bootFNSA.service`

12:32 PM

getting sucked into crap back to producing things

losing track of what I'm trying to do... the IMU data to threejs plot real time yeah

at the end of the day it would be a basic thread you start like "stream telemetry" or something and that would get displayed on ThreeJS to track the robot head's orientation and trajectory over time.

2:56 PM

back from brief break, non-linear time above (been recording videos of this project)

I have been stuck with trying to pass the data from the thread into the class, so that that websocket can send it to the web interface

it's probably some instance/wrong time to bridge to pointer thing

oh yeah I will have to understand kinematics to some point to pull this thing off... possibly throw in vectors/magnitude or trig in there

don't know if I need to use quaternions yet, that's something on my to learn list to represent true point sphere rotation/orientation

3:48 PM

I scooted the unit about 10" on my desk, Y axis, got some logs, unfortunately a lot/too much

I'll get some function working

4:57 PM

- need to figure out sitting still threshold for good values
- make real world motion match value
  - means math is right for displacement
