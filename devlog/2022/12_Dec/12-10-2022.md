Dang this is hard...

The camera is mounted ahead of the pan axis, and it is also mounted above the tilt axis

Further the axis are not perpendicular/aligned with the ground and horizon, it's stightly tilted backwards due to the body having an upwards tilt (tail dragger).

Those factors combined, make the panorama hard to do, since you have to scale and rotate the images to try and align them so the edges line up.

Easiest solution is to buy a wide-angle camera and skip this process... but I really don't want to deal with buying stuff. I can... I have the funds.

Yeah... thought about it, new problem with fish eye lense type is the distortion

Also hard to tell if these cameras are good eg. missing IR filter or something (pink images)

Get good scrub

I am cheating... I'm not really using a smart image-processing approach, I'm using manual validations eg. sketchup/gimp to find rotation angle/scaling

Yeah... if I find something to align by like some straight line (rug on carpet in my case) other parts of the image are not ligned up/still need rotation

The scale is also wrong

Well... I'm not gonna get anywhere with this

I can't align the image... it's like distorted somehow, skewed

If I align one part, another part is broken

I need to examine the mechanical change due to the angle of rotation/camera placement... I don't really understand camera FOV and how all that stuff works

What I could do is figure out a calibration offset against a flat wall with the sensors... to know what is expected/the offset from tilting

Ideally the IMU can compensate, would know the angle of the camera... but the accuracy of that is also poor and not well understood by me

### sensors

12" away from a wall

ToF reads 12.44"

Lidar reads 10.92" (yeah this sensor is more accurate beyond 24", also depends what library is being used)

This is actually a lot too moving 500 ms each way

look left 500ms

ToF 17.66"
Lidar 18.33"

look right 500ms

ToF 18.29"
Lidar 14.82" (there is a t-shirt in the way let me redo)

same value even after moving shirt

Let me get these angles from sketchup (should be from imu)

Left is 46.2" from middle

Right is 45.4 from middle

The thing is... this stuff shouldn't have to be rigid/absolute

If you wanted absolute you could use an encoder

The smart thing is if software compensates
