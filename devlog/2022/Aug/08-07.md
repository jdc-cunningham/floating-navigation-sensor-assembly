Figure [this out](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/97995/rpi-python-i2c-ioerror-errno-121-remote-i-o-error-problem-how-to-fix-it
)

Do something hard with fresh brain

Maybe design how the robot deals with state

Also figure out the commands based on degrees turned on wheeled robot and desired distance (circumference) confirm with reality

8:55 AM
Ahh fresh brain, what will I do today mmm.

So... this is interesting, the imu started working after I pulled out the ToF set.

Well actually I also have to unplug the LED and servos hmmm

I can get more lines but it's still unstable dang

```

ugh... man this sucks

might be inevitable in the future to have a separate microcontroller controlling the hardware and attach it to the Pi

Anyway I can work with this, I tried this other code [here](https://www.electronicwings.com/raspberry-pi/mpu6050-accelerometergyroscope-interfacing-with-raspberry-pi)

It does a little better, I had to do the [delay trick](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52735862/getting-ioerror-errno-121-remote-i-o-error-with-smbus-on-python-raspberry-w) to improve it but eventually it still stops and fails.

I mean it would be nice to have a thread running that's constantly reading the MPU6050 but I can't keep it alive it seems... can restart it I suppose when it dies.

To the forums!

yeah it does better when nothing else is plugged in.

So the problem with the IMU not being able to run on its own continuously is I can't use it to estimate velocity/how far the robot actually moved.

I need to run that while it talks to the other half of the robot then compare the difference from stopped, moving, stopped to check if it moved as far as expected.

I'm having a bad... desperate idea... I'm thinking I will use a Seeeduino (small form factor) and use that to read the MPU6050 and then send it to the RPi which doesn't seem to make sense due to the i2c problem to begin with. But I could use serial to talk from Pi to Seeeduino.

10:12 AM

trying to have Seeeduino read IMU

Well I got it working... the issue is there is only one tx/rx port on the Pi it seems. So I would need to use SPI or if I2C cooperates, that.

I'm going to test the i2c reliability with the Pi to Seeeduino

BMS kicked in nice battery is at 3V though hmm

I got code running on the Seeeduino to read from MPU6050 but damn it'll suck if I have to do this route... have to do an i2c or SPI bridge between Pi/Seeeduino

I'm kind of blocked mentally until I figure out if this MPU problem is fixed or not...

Soon I'll start putting together the system design though.

11:38 AM

Sidetracked from charging

I'm going to work out the distance traveled by the wheels per command/come up with a command string sequence

5.17" absolute diameter (stubs)

5" pad diameter

circumference 2pir is 15.7"

it's more accurate than that but also this wheel is not a good circle, it has a lot of flat edges.

So each degree is 0.04"

Probably do mf_12 (degrees) ... ehhh

I'll use the inches and rotate degrees

12:09 PM

Kind of chilling, messing around

I'm working on the motion stuff

Trying to figure out if the wheels rotate in opposite directions at some degree, how many degrees did the robot turn?

Roughly 3.6" inner radius, using SketchUp to figure out the degrees turned

So 1" forward is 15.5 degrees

This is where self testing works well... the reality expectation vs. IMU in case of slippage and visual checking of known landmarks.

1:05 PM

Crap... I don't think I have this right, I did not factor in the speed of the rotation and time it runs for

It's not bad

1:24 PM

I just had a neat idea for the UI, I can import a glTf export of the sensor assembly and represent its state in 3D on a little window. Also show camera feed (possibly live) and decisions performed in steps below as a history will include drawing.

it moves 1 and 11/16" forward with 1 command

1.6875" at 250ms let me see if I do it longer does that matter, think it's just delay

Oh my god it goes farther, like twice as far hmm

at 150ms looks like it moves about 1.25"

Hmm dropped it to 1 degree apart and it doesn't move interesting

turning is good here

will need to spend more time on this to really understand what's happening

not just physically measure it, figure out some ratio and use it as a function
2:31 PM

ahhh.... so the IMU is still having problems.

If I unplug everything the connection is more stable but it still dies eventually

I'll try the other bus set one more time but yeah... I'll probably have to use SPI to connect to the Seeeduino that then connects to the IMU... ahhh man just more work

Damn... yeah it's gonna have to be done... I just have not used SPI before so I'll have to take time to figure out how to do that.

This looks like a nice [guide](https://roboticsbackend.com/raspberry-pi-master-arduino-uno-slave-spi-communication-with-wiringpi/)

I want to get to a good spot so I'm going to try this, it looks short.

I need to have bidirectional data messaging between them.

What will happen is the IMU will run on a fast loop that can dump data when requested by the Pi

Well this is cool the MOSI/MISO (soup)

I'm just gonna go for it...

3:39 PM

Not sure if I'm going to get this to work, I'm already burnt

Already having problems the SPI code won't compile hmm

Oh okay that code is for AVR not SAMD

https://forum.arduino.cc/t/error-expected-constructor-destructor-or-type-conversion-before/653777/2s

Ugh... I'm just gonna enable another serial set and use that

https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/127265/multiple-uarts-on-the-40-pin

Ahh only thing that sucks is the serial buffer build up concern on the Seeeduino hmm

I will make this work even if it's ugly

ahh damn it's for pi4 not pi zero 2 w

hmm............. I could try software serial they said "error free" but idk

Alright this is not happening right now, I have to go with the SPI route because I've used software serial before and it was not good.

They're talking about error rates [here](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=35544).

ahh man... dang I'm spent now, need to do nothing for the rest of the day

still at it, I have a little under 3 hours left

https://github.com/ramiss/SeeeduinoXIAO_SPISlave

Ooh it compiles

ahh man... it is using the pins that the IMU is using hmm....

Ahh... it's unfortunate this was written for a specific use

nice looking link
https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/16348/how-do-you-use-spi-on-an-arduino

So... this is overkill but I'm going to use a Nano to be the SPI slave

5:10 PM

Damn I might have killed this MPU6050, since Arduino Nano has 5V rails ahh well... that's why you have more than 1

I'm back to where I was before though... I need to figure out how to get SPI to work on the Seeeduino

I'm spent now... damn feel sad
